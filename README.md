Welcome to MythOS! 👋
Hi, I’m Ronak, and this is MythOS, my journey into building a minimalist, productivity-focused operating system from scratch! 🚀

This project is my attempt to explore the fascinating world of Operating Systems (OS) and understand how computers work at their core. From writing a custom bootloader in Assembly to building a kernel in C++ and adding features like a command-line interface (CLI), task manager, and Pomodoro timer, MythOS is a hands-on learning experience for me—and now, for you too!

Why I Built MythOS
I’ve always been passionate about problem-solving, simplifying complex systems, and diving deep into topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Computer Organization and Architecture (COA), and Operating Systems. MythOS combines all these interests into one challenging yet rewarding project.

Whether you're curious about OS development or just want to explore the journey of building something from scratch, this repository is here to document every step of the process.

What You’ll Find Here
In this repository, you’ll find:
✅ A custom bootloader that starts the OS.
✅ A basic kernel written in C++ for managing hardware and processes.
✅ A simple CLI with commands like tasks, timer, and logwork.
✅ Productivity tools like a Pomodoro timer, task manager, and basic file system.
✅ Step-by-step documentation of the entire development process.

Let’s Build Together!
Feel free to explore the code, follow along with the documentation, or even contribute if you’re interested in OS development. If you have any questions or just want to chat about operating systems, problem-solving, or simplifying workflows, don’t hesitate to reach out! 😊

Let’s dive into MythOS and discover how operating systems come to life! 🎉
