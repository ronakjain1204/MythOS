# MythOS
Welcome to MythOS, a minimalist productivity-focused operating system built from scratch! 🚀
MythOS is designed to simplify workflows and enhance efficiency while providing a hands-on learning experience in operating system development. Built with low-level programming (Assembly & C++) and inspired by the principles of simplicity and functionality, MythOS features:

A custom bootloader and kernel.

A command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.

Productivity tools like a Pomodoro timer, task manager, and time tracker.

Basic file system support for storing notes and tasks.

This project is perfect for anyone curious about OS development or looking to explore how computers work at their core. Follow along as we build MythOS step by step! 😊
